<h2>Time period of a pendulum help</h2>
<h3>About the experiment</h3>
<p>The experiment shws a pendulum attached to a wooden stand oscillating around it's fixed hinge</p>
<h3>Animation control</h3>
<p>The top line has animation controls. There are two states of the experiment.</p>
<h3>The setup stage</h3>
<p>The initial state is setup stage. In this stage, you can see a control window at the right. You have access to one sliders.</p>
<p>You can control the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Length&nbsp;:&nbsp;Controls the length of the pendulum.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you setup the experiment, you can enter the animation stage by clicking the start button</p>
<h3>The animation stage</h3>
<p>In the animation stage, the pendulum will oscillate</p>
<p>The left hand side you can see a analog+digital stop watch which show's the time passed.</p>
<p>The right hand side you can see also see the length , no. of oscilattion and the time too .</p>
<ul>
<li>Length&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp;Current length.</li>
<li>Oscillation&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp;Total no. of Oscilation.</li>
<li>Time(s)&nbsp;:&nbsp;Shows the time in secs.</li>
<li>Time(ms)&nbsp;:&nbsp;Shows the time in milli second.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can pause and resume the animation by using the pause/play nutton on the top line</p>
<p>You can slow down and speed up the animaion by uing the speed control buttons</p>
<h3>The drag and drop</h3>
<p>You can also position the ball by dragging and dropping it. You can only do this in the setup stage. This has been prevented in the animation stage.</p>
<h2>Happy Experimenting</h2>
