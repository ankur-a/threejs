<h2>Time period of a pendulum experiment concepts</h2>
<h3>About the experiment</h3>
<p>The experiment shws a pendulum attached to a wooden stand oscillating around it's fixed hinge.</p>
<h3>Oscillation</h3>
<p>When the angle of rotation is small preferably < 20 degrees the ball oscillating around its hinge behaves like a simple pendulum.</p>
<p>The time period is independent of the weight of the bob and depends only on the gravitational pull and mean length of the pendulum.</p>
<p>If the angle of oscillation increses then it starts depending on the angle found using a infinite series.</p>
<p> The time period is calculated using = .</p> <MATH>T = <SQRT>(l/g)</SQRT></MATH>
<p>l is the length of the time period</p>
<p>g is the gravitational constant usually taken as 9.8 in mks units .</p>
